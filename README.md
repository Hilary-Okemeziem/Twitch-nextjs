Live demo: https://twitch-nextjs.vercel.app/

This Twitch clone was built with Next JS and is hosted on Vercel.

I made use of Mock data for all of the data and NextAuth.js for user authentication so users can sign-up and sign-in to their account using either Github or Google.

I made use of some Headless UI components for my navbar.

The project was styled with Tailwind CSS
